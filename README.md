# Hello-World
Mijn eerste repository

I've been making Wordpress sites for quite some time and now it's time to learn some more and do different things. So I started with 100 days of code 15 days ago. Until now it's real fun. 
And right now I'm learning GitHub and Git.

I did some changes and tried to merge but I don't think it worked out. I'll try another one.

Another try, it's not that easy!
